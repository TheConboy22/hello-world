**My name is Christopher Conboy**

I have made the decision that I needed ~~to find~~ a career to pursue. I have decided that I would _deep dive_ into coding and this will be my first _dive_ into Github, but I intend to take it very seriously. <sub>Not affiliated with any corporation or celestial entity</sub>

As George Eliot said 
>It is never to late to be what you might have been.

Most of my life has been spent working the customer and business support side of the corporate world for large organizations such as PayPal, The Northern Trust and Verizon Wireless. While this allowed me to make money it has never been quite fulfilling and the growth hasn't been what I had expected. With the rising cost of living and the lack of increase in pay led me to search for other avenues. 

Technology has always been a hobby of mine. From a young age I've worked on computers. Mostly the repairing of the hardware side of things, but the software has always fascinated me. Over the last year I have been studying different languages of coding and have enjoyed working with Javascript quite a lot. I've done most of this through the Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtman. I intend to take a coding bootcamp in June and that will hopefully be enough to change my career trajectory.
